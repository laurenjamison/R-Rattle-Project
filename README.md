# R-Rattle-Project
For my final Data Mining Project, my group's dataset is an extract of demographic
characteristics, vital signs, and laboratory values data from a 24-hour period of patients
admitted to the ICU for heart failure. We targeted the mortality outcomes of patients to predict
the most important features and measurements in fatal heart failure cases.

## General Information
The business goal of our model is to predict the mortality rate of patients who enter the
ICU (Intensive Care Units) due to heart failure. This model will be used to provide doctors with
information about what patients they need to prioritize in order to reduce patient-in-house
mortality rates.

## Features
* PowerPoint Presentation
* Project Report
* Rattle file

## Setup
Found a dataset on Kaggle, cleaned this data through Excel and Rattle and performed any data pre-processing through Rattle to transform the data to resolve any issues and make the dataset more complete and efficient to perform the data analysis. 

## Project Status
This project is complete. Our group worked on this project during the Fall Semester of 2021 at the University of Iowa for our Data Mining course.

## What I Learned
I learned how to use R and Rattle. I learned the importance of cleaning data and data visualization.
